### Description  
This app was made to calculate the probability of death in the current day based on your life style. This probability is totally invented by the author and doesn't have ANY cientific study to support it. Please don't consider to see real values in this application.  

### Input Data    
There are three inputs that must be made:  
1) Age: Insert your age. The age must be between 18 and 100.  
2) Cigarrets smoked per day: Insert the number of cigarretes you smoke per day, if you are a non smoker just insert 0 (default value). The values must be between 0 and 100.  
3) Days of exercise per week: Insert the number of days that you do exercises per week. The default value is 0 and this text box must contain values between 0 and 7.  

### Output  
On the output you will see the probability of death in that day or a error message if you entered wrong values.  

### Formula to calculate the probability  
The probability, invented by the author, is calculated using the formula:  
(age / 800) + (smoke / 600) - (exercise / 400)
